			Originally created sometime in the 19th century and given a name in the 1880's, the Old Fashioned was the first attempt to make liquor taste better. It is one of the first known cocktails, and the first to be named as such. In a nod to the tradtional way of making this drink, club soda would not have been used; however, it's entirely up to you how you would enjoy it.<br>
			In today's world of bartending, the Old Fashioned is a good way to try new bourbons or whiskeys. There's literally hundreds of variations of this drink especially because it has been around for so long. There's only one recipe offered here, but that'just to act as an easy introduction to the world of cocktail making.<br>
			If you're really wanting to stick to the original form of the drink, you'll need ice that forms a 2-inch by 2-inch cube. This is to reduce the amount of dilution caused by the ice. Otherwise, most any type of cubed ice will work.
			<br><br>
			<strong>1.</strong> To make this classic, you begin by muddling the sugar cube and bitters in the bottom of an old fashioned glass<br><br>
			<strong>2.</strong> Add in your ice and pour in your bourbon of choice<br><br>
			<strong>3.</strong> Stir well and top with a splash of club soda if so desired<br><br>
			<strong>4.</strong> Garnish with a cherry and orange peel and enjoy!
